# Monke-Phone

Monke-Phone is a general purpose cosmetic mod for Gorilla-Tag.

This Monke-Phone version does not have access to uploading images to the discord. You can still take and view photos on the phone!

To find the photos that you have taken open File Explorer and go to this location: `BelpInx\MonkePhone\Photos` or access them ingame via the gallary app.


 ##  Take selfies showing off new outfits:

 ##  Or even take photos of new maps / game updates:

Whatever you decide to do, Monke-Phone is fully networked and has a replicated view of the camera for simple photography with other players. To make the phone stay floating in the air hold `A` and let go!
